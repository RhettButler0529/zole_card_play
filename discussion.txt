Let me re-cover the errors you mentioned again.
1. sometimes, users cannot move card(on allowed/enabled cards), so s(he) missed turn. and not sure in which case this happens. never considered it.
2. You get message of missed turn, but actually another play missed his(her) turn. so wrong missed turn message error.
3. Uses cannot join to the rooms on his(her) mobile and some recent modeled iPhone.
(If there is anything I missed, then Please let me know.)

Skiming your project code and docs referenced, I figured out it will takes about 3 days for grasping whole project architecture.
The things if we have to use websocket or other sdk module would be clear after that. I will explain that points to you by then.
No worries, I will take it solved as soon as possible. 

And for this timely manner project, I have willing to take daily report to you, so you can see progress obviously.
For this project, I can work 5 hours per day or more if you want. and the rate is $30/hr as you know.

we have to promise working and paying must be clear and non-regrettable each other.
If you have more detail plan, then let me know. I would be happy if you have.

and here is sth need to be considered between us.
Since this is important project for you and me, communication between us would be flexible.
and as you know, there's so many restrict option on freelancer chat.
So I suggest we could use another chat system like skype or slack. Of course, it's up to your mind whether you choose which method.
please let me know if you are agree with this. my skype name: live:.cid.b8321afc29387c43
